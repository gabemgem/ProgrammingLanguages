History of SALSA</A>
</H1>
SALSA has been developed since 1998 by Carlos A. Varela, who was a Ph.D. student directed by Gul Agha at
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). During the UIUC period, Gregory Haik, a student of Gul Agha, 
has contributions to the naming service of the very early SALSA. 
Carlos A. Varela founded the Worldwide Computing Laboratory and continued the development of SALSA
when he became a faculty member at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2001.
Many of his students have participated in the SALSA project since then,
including Wei-Jen Wang,
Travis Desell, Kaoutar El Maghraoui, Jason LaPorte,
Abe Stephens, and Robin Toll.
Abe Stephens and Travis Desell were the major contributors of the early version of SALSA at RPI.
They worked together from 2001 until Abe Stephens graduated. Robin Toll has helped 
the early SALSA compiler during this period of time.
From 2003 to 2004, Travis Desell has committed a thoroughly change on the early SALSA, which then became the
foundation of the current version of SALSA. Advanced features such as message properties, 
name tokens, and join block continuations were introduced at that time. 
Wei-Jen Wang and Kaoutar El Maghraoui joined the SALSA project since 2003.
Kaoutar El Maghraoui has major contributions to the development of the communication layer of 
the latest SALSA.
Wei-Jen Wang has been a major developer since 2004. 
He made another major change on SALSA in 2004 and released it in 2005. 
He introduced actor garbage collection,
fault-tolerance communication using persistent sockets and messages, 
actor name deletion support for naming services, and passing-by-value message delivery.      
Jason LaPorte joined the SALSA project in 2006. His contributions relate to  
the interface between SALSA and the OverView project.
