The Live Unblocked Actor Principle
</H2>
In actor-oriented programming languages, an actor must be able to access 
resources which are encapsulated in service actors. To access a resource, an actor
requires a reference to it. This implies that actors keep persistent references to
some special service actors -- such as the file system service and the standard
output service. Furthermore, an actor can explicitly create references to public
services. For instance, an actor can dynamically convert a string into a reference to
communicate with a service actor, analogous to accessing a web service by a web
browser using a URL.

<P>
Without program analysis techniques,
the ability of an actor to access resources provided by 
an actor-oriented programming language implies 
explicit reference creation to access service actors. The
ability to access local service actors (e.g. the standard output) and explicit 
reference creation to public service actors make the statement true: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">every
actor has persistent references to root actors</SPAN>. This statement is important
 because it changes the meaning of actor GC, making actor GC similar to passive
object GC. It leads to the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">live unblocked actor principle</SPAN>, 
which says every unblocked actor is live. Since
each unblocked actor is: 1) an inverse acquaintance of the root actors and 2)
defined as potentially live, it is live according to the definition of actor GC.
With the live unblocked actor principle, every unblocked actor can be viewed
as a root. Liveness of blocked actors depends on the transitive reachability from
unblocked actors and root actors. If a blocked actor is transitively reachable
from an unblocked actor or a root actor, it is defined as potentially live. With
persistent root references, such potentially live, blocked actors are live because
they are inverse acquaintances of some root actors.

<P>
Notice that the live unblocked actor principle may not be true 
if considering resource access restrictions. This implies that
different security models may result in different sets of actor garbage,
given the same actor system.
At the programming language level, SALSA assumes the live unblocked actor principle.
